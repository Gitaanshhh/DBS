// Idea
Make an ER Model and schema for me My project is a room booking and management system customizable for colleges, it mainly functions on students booking a classroom/auditorium/seminar hall/labs etc for meetings like fest organizing meeting/ GBMs for student clubs/ rooms for a student project, etc at multiple slots on various days. The faculty has the authority to approve or reject the request to book said venue.

At first the Admin maps all the venues in the college so when I, the Admin, is building this model for college A, I will input that it has say 5 buildings, building 1 has m rooms, n seminar halls, o auditoriums, p open spaces across q floors, with particular atrributes like floor_number, room_number, booking_status, seating_capacity, floor_manager_contact_number, etc.

Every student body has a { unique_id, faculty_advisor id, name, name_of_student_body; name, id, contact details of primary_club_represent and secondary_represent} Each student has their personal registration id. The students booking these places are board members of their respective student bodies

Every faculty member also has their unique registration id, post, name, department. Some faculty members are the faculty_advisor of student clubs so we are only storing them in our database. We are also keeping the faculty members on the higher administrative posts in the college.

Every booking will be done by certain student bodies, for a particular venue, in a building, on certain days, for certain time periods that can not overlap with other bookings for the same venue, date. 

The process to confirm a booking goes through in a pipelined manner. When a student requests for a booking, first the respective faculty advisor of the student body has to approve it, then a student from the student council has to approve it, then the Head of the Student Welfare Office has to approve it (the Head of Student Welfare Office is a faculty member). Then at last the Security Section Head has to approve it. 

There should also exist a main record that keeps a log of all the past bookings done in the college.

Make an ER diagram, a schema diagram, all the respective entity-relation tables, tell us what logic goes in the frontend, backend  and what must be stored in the database. Also give us a timeline for this project, features and insights on how to approach building this project using python in backend, javascript frameworks in frontend and a suitable relational database
