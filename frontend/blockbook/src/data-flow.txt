Frontend–Backend Flow

1. On login, POST credentials to /api/auth/login/.
    Backend returns a JWT and the user’s role (student, student-council, faculty, swo, security).

2. Use the role to redirect:
    Faculty/FA/SWO/Security: /approval
    Student/Student Council: /home (main app)

3. The Approval page fetches pending requests for the current user’s approval stage:
    GET /api/approval-requests/?role=FA (or SC, SWO, Security)

4. Approve/Reject buttons POST to:
    /api/approval-requests/<booking_id>/approve/
    /api/approval-requests/<booking_id>/reject/

5. Backend updates the request’s status and moves it to the next stage in the pipeline:
    FA → SC → SWO → Security

6. Each stage only sees requests pending their approval.

Backend (Django) Suggestions
1. Use Django REST Framework for APIs.
2. Store the current approval stage in each BookingRequest or a related ApprovalProcess table.
3. When a request is approved at one stage, update the stage to the next approver.
4. Only show requests at the user’s stage (filter by current_stage).
5. Use Django’s permissions to ensure only the right users see the right requests.

Frontend-Backend Integration


To connect this React frontend with your Django backend, we'll need to implement several integration points:

# API Service Layer #
    Create a service layer in your React application to handle API calls:

src/services/api.js
    Set up Axios or fetch with base configuration
    Handle authentication headers
    Implement error handling and response processing
src/services/venueService.js
    Functions for fetching venues, filtering, and searching
    Methods for retrieving venue details and availability
src/services/bookingService.js
    Functions for creating, updating, and canceling bookings
    Methods for fetching user's bookings in different states
src/services/userService.js
    Authentication functions (login, logout, register)
    User profile management
src/services/notificationService.js
    Functions for fetching, marking as read, and deleting notifications
src/services/chatService.js
    Functions for fetching conversations and messages
    Methods for sending messages


# Authentication and State Management #
src/context/AuthContext.jsx
    Manage user authentication state
    Store JWT tokens or session information
    Provide login/logout functionality to components
src/utils/authUtils.js
    Helper functions for token management
    Authentication status checking

# Data Fetching Strategy #
Replace hardcoded data with API calls in the custom hooks:

In useVenueBooking.js:
    Replace localStorage with API calls to fetch and store venue data
    Use React Query or SWR for data fetching and caching
In useExploreVenues.js:
    Implement API calls for venue filtering
    Use debouncing for search inputs to reduce API calls
In useBookingManagement.js:
    Replace local state with API calls to fetch bookings
    Implement optimistic updates for better UX
In useNotifications.js:
    Fetch notifications from the API
    Implement real-time updates with WebSockets or polling
In useChat.js:
    Implement WebSocket connection for real-time messaging
    Fetch conversation history from the API

# Django Backend Structure #
Your Django backend should provide RESTful APIs that match the frontend's data needs:

Authentication API: 
    Login/logout endpoints
    Token or session management
    User registration and profile management
Venues API:
    List venues with filtering options
    Venue details with features and images
    Availability checking
Bookings API:
    Create booking requests
    Update booking status
    List user's bookings by status
    Cancel bookings
Community API:
    List community bookings
    Exchange request functionality
    Search and filtering
Notifications API:
    List user notifications
    Mark as read/unread
    Delete notifications
Chat API:
    List conversations
    Fetch messages
    Send messages

# Real-time Features #
For features requiring real-time updates:

WebSockets with Django Channels:
    Implement for chat functionality
    Use for real-time notifications
    Update booking status in real-time
Polling as Fallback:
    Implement periodic API calls for less critical updates
    Use for notification checking

Data Flow Example: Booking Process



Let's trace the complete data flow for booking a venue:

User browses venues on the Home or ExploreVenues page
Frontend calls venueService.getVenues() with filter parameters
Django processes the request through a venue list API view
Database query filters venues based on parameters
API returns filtered venues to the frontend
React renders the venue cards
User clicks "Book Now" on a venue
useVenueBooking hook stores venue ID (not the full object)
React Router navigates to the booking page
Booking page calls venueService.getVenueDetails(venueId)
Django fetches complete venue details
React renders the booking form with venue information
User selects date and time, fills the form
Frontend validates inputs
On submit, calls bookingService.createBooking(bookingData)
Django validates the request
Database transaction creates the booking record
API returns success/failure response
React shows confirmation and redirects to My Bookings
Admin reviews the booking
Admin approves/rejects through admin interface
Django updates booking status
WebSocket notification sent to user
Frontend receives notification and updates UI
Notification appears in the user's notification center
Error Handling and Loading States
Implement consistent error handling and loading states:

Loading States:
    Use React Suspense or local loading states
    Show skeleton screens or loading spinners

Error Handling:
    Implement error boundaries for component-level errors
    Show user-friendly error messages
    Log detailed errors for debugging

Offline Support:
    Consider implementing service workers for basic offline functionality
    Cache critical data for better user experience

Implementation Strategy
To transition from the current hardcoded data to a fully integrated system:

Phase 1: API Service Layer
    Implement API services without changing components
    Create mock API responses that match current hardcoded data
    Test API integration in isolation
Phase 2: Hook Refactoring
    Refactor one hook at a time to use API services
    Implement proper loading and error states
    Test each hook thoroughly before moving to the next
Phase 3: Real-time Features
    Implement WebSocket connections for chat
    Add real-time notifications
    Test real-time updates across different devices
Phase 4: Authentication Integration
    Implement login/logout functionality
    Add protected routes
    Test user session management
Phase 5: Performance Optimization
    Implement data caching strategies
    Optimize API calls with batching and pagination
    Add lazy loading for non-critical components
